# Solar System Explorer

A responsive web visualization of the solar system that lets users explore planetary information and characteristics. The project is built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** and is deployed as a fully client-side web application.

## 🚀 Overview

This project presents an interactive model of our solar system with all eight major planets and Pluto (as a dwarf planet). Each celestial body displays its basic attributes such as **planet name**, **orbital radius**, and **descriptive facts** about the planet and its moons. The interface is designed to be both visually engaging and educational.

The content updates dynamically as users scroll or navigate through planets, providing an intuitive way to learn about solar system objects.

## ✨ Features

- **Responsive Single-Page UI:** Clean layout with easy navigation between planetary sections.
- **Planetary Information:** Fact blocks for each planet including distance from the Sun (in AU), moons, and descriptions. 
- **No Backend Required:** Fully static — no server or database needed.
- **Educational Focus:** Content suitable for learners and general audiences interested in basic astronomy.

## 🧠 How It Works (Technical)

- **HTML:** Defines the structure of the solar system content and placeholders for planet descriptions.
- **CSS:** Implements layout, typography, and responsive design to ensure the UI adjusts smoothly across devices.

Since the entire app is static, all visual content and text are delivered directly in the browser, making it very lightweight and fast to load.
